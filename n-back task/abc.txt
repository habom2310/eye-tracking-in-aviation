Hi, I would like to ask about getting the license if I'm holding an oversea license. I have finished the car driver knowledge test last year, and now I want to book for the hazard test. I've tried to book for the hazard test but I'm unable to do so because it asks for learner permit number but what I have now is only the test result with customer number. In the vicroad website, I see there is option to do the hazard test online, I created an account but I don't know how to add my knowledge test result before to that account and then book for the hazard test online.
